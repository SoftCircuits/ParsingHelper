## Overview

ParsingHelper is a .NET class library to assist pasing text. It helps by tracking the current position within the text being parsed and by ensuring you never access characters beyond the end of the text. It also provides a number of helper methods to ease some parsing tasks.

## Getting Started

The ParsingHelper constructor accepts a string argument, which represents the text you are going to parse.
